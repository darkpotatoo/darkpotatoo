# Hi! I'm darkpotatoo!
I'm also known as **darkpotatoben** online. I've been programming for about four years.

I've been learning some java and python for about 5 years.
I also use **skript**, a simple english-based minecraft server plugin that allows you to write code for almost anything imaginable if you know how to use it.

I also have a good knowledge of HTML5 and CSS, although you can barely call those programming languages. (Hypertext ***Markup*** Language)
